CEG-4110 HW 1: Random Color Selector & Drawing Pad

This android application was made for the first homework assignment for CEG-4110 at Wright State. 
It is a relatively simple app consisting of two parts: a random color selector and a drawing pad. 
The random color selector allows the user to enter text and changes the text to a random color and 
the drawing pad allows the user to draw images onto the screen with different colors with save functionality.
